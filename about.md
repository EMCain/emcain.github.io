title: About Emily
---

I make websites and mobile apps with Python, Bootstrap, React, and Sass.

I've worked with Go, PHP, Ruby, and SQL.

I also write about software and the learning process. You can check out my work on [my own blog](/) and at my [O'Reilly author page](https://www.oreilly.com/people/emily_cain).

When I'm not working with tech, I enjoy lifting weights, board games, hiking, and volunteering.
