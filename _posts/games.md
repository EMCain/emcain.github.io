Some JavaScript games you can play in the browser--check them out!

[Minesweeper]({{site.baseurl}}/minesweeper) - My friends and I were doing mock whiteboard interviews, and "build a minesweeper game" was the question I got. I started off building it in Python, but realized it would be easier to complete a finished version with JavaScript. I also took the opportunity to practice object-oriented JavaScript. 

[Blackjack]({{site.baseurl}}/card-games/blackjack.html) - I made this for a coding challenge and liked it so much I decided to keep building it.
